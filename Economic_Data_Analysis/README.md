Objective
To explore and analyze key economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates to understand their relationships and forecast future GDP trends using time-series models.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Machine Learning:** ARIMA Model (Statsmodels)
- **Libraries:** Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
- **Data Sources:** World Bank, FRED, Economic Datasets

## Process Overview
1. Collected historical macroeconomic data from global sources.
2. Cleaned and merged datasets for multiple indicators.
3. Conducted correlation and trend analysis among GDP, inflation, and unemployment.
4. Performed **time-series forecasting** using ARIMA model.
5. Visualized GDP and inflation patterns using line and scatter plots.

##  Challenges Faced
- Handling missing values and aligning date ranges.
- Stationarity testing and parameter tuning for ARIMA.
- Managing multi-variable interdependencies.

## Results & Insights
- GDP and unemployment displayed a **negative correlation**.
- Inflation was moderately correlated with interest rate changes.
- ARIMA model successfully forecasted GDP trends with realistic error bounds.

## Key Learnings
- Time series forecasting with ARIMA.
- Understanding economic indicator interrelations.
- Practical application of correlation and regression for policy-level insights.
