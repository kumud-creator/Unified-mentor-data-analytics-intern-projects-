Objective
To analyze the 2020 Indian road accident dataset and study causes, outcomes, and regional trends to identify patterns that can help improve road safety and traffic regulations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Excel**
- **Data Source:** Ministry of Road Transport, India
- **Key Techniques:** Data cleaning, grouping, aggregation, visualization

## Process Overview
1. Imported and cleaned accident data across 50+ cities.
2. Categorized causes into traffic control, road features, weather, and driver behavior.
3. Calculated total, fatal, and injury-based accident outcomes.
4. Visualized trends by city and cause using bar charts and heatmaps.
5. Summarized correlations between accident type and outcome severity.

## Challenges Faced
- Missing or zero-value records for smaller cities.
- Multiple categorical variables requiring encoding.
- Visual clutter in multi-variable charts.

## Results & Insights
- **Delhi, Mumbai, and Lucknow** recorded highest accident counts.
- Most frequent causes: **Road features** and **traffic violations**.
- Identified correlations between urban congestion and fatal accidents.

## Key Learnings
- Handling categorical and grouped data in pandas.
- Translating analytics into actionable policy insights.
- Effective visualization and storytelling from public datasets.
